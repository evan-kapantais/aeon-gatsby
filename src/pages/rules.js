              <p>
                Needless to say that the use of any third party programs,
                especially hacking and bot programs that alter the normal use
                and enjoyment of the game will lead to permanent banning. It
                does not matter whether the software was being used in our
                server or somewhere else, if any forbidden software is detected
                in the computer while playing in our server, the account will be
                inevitably banned.

                The usage of virtual machines, remote desktop applications,
                multiple computers, etc. to attempt to bypass launcher, control
                more than one character, as well as any attempt to bypass
                official L2Aeon launcher is strictly forbidden and will lead to
                the permanent ban of all the accounts involved.

                Furthermore, ANY mechanism (including macro /nexttarget

                recording software etc.) that allows you to farm in an automated
                manner (ie. killing mobs while player is away from keyboard), or
                any kind of interaction with the game is strictly forbidden and
                will lead to the permanent ban of the account. A character can‚Äôt
                earn experience if the user is not playing.

                There should also be a special mention about the importance of
                not leaving your account to anyone. Do it at your own risk but
                you are ultimately responsible of what happens to the account.
                This means that if anyone logs in your account with any illegal
                software the account will be banned. Needless to say that the
                staff will not get involved if one day you find your character
                naked because you trusted the wrong person.
